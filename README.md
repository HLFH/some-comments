Some comments
=============

Aims to become a free standing commenting system that you attach by including javascript.  I need
this because Ghost has no commenting function and I don't want ads funded commenting, nor tie it to
one specific social platform.

All the commenters have to authenticate via 3rd party authentication like openid, google, facebook
etc; currently anything that "passport" supports.

This is not ready for use.  I'm experimenting in learning nodejs, and I haven't even found a good
name.  My working names were "restful comments" and "comment anything", but they are both already
taken.
